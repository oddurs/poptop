# How it works

The page size is read from `/proc/self/auxv` at startup rather than assumed.
RSS is a count of pages multiplied by it, so a hardcoded 4096 reports every
process at a quarter of its real memory on a 16 KiB-page kernel and a sixteenth
on a 64 KiB one — Asahi and RHEL aarch64 respectively — and nothing about the
output looks wrong. Where the kernel will not say, poptop assumes 4096 and says
that it did.

Two backends behind one `Collector` trait:

- **Linux** (`src/collect/linux.rs`) parses `/proc` directly with nothing but
  `std`. This is the interesting one. It handles the parts that catch people
  out: `/proc/[pid]/stat` field 2 can contain spaces *and* parentheses, so it
  splits on the last `)` rather than on whitespace; `guest` and `guest_nice` in
  `/proc/stat` are already counted inside `user` and `nice`, so summing every
  field double-counts them; and every CPU figure is a delta between two reads,
  which is why the first sample always reports zero.
- **macOS/other** (`src/collect/darwin.rs`) goes through `sysinfo`, so the tool
  runs on a dev laptop. There is no `/proc` here and the mach calls that replace
  it are a different project's worth of `unsafe`.

History lives in a fixed-capacity ring buffer (`src/history.rs`). "Live" is
represented as *absence* of a cursor rather than an index pinned to the end, so
there is exactly one representation of it and pushes never have to fix the
cursor up. When the window slides, a pinned cursor slides with it — otherwise it
would silently drift forward through time while appearing to stay put.

Ten minutes of scrollback at one sample per second, which is roughly 30 MB of
process tables on a busy machine.
